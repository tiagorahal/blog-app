> In this project, i create all controllers and views for your Blog app and add simple placeholders for your views with plain HTML.


**This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.**
**Modify this file to match your project, remove sections that don't apply. For example: delete the testing section if the currect project doesn't require testing.**



To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


- To run the app in your terminal run this command:
  `rails s`

- To run test first make sure the data is in the db: 
  `bundle exec rake db:drop RAILS_ENV=test`
  `bundle exec rake db:create RAILS_ENV=test`
  `bundle exec rake db:schema:load RAILS_ENV=test`

- If your sure you have the data in the db, you can run the test:
  `bundle exec rspec || rspec`
